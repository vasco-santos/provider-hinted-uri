# üîé Exploration: Provider-Hinted URIs for Content-Addressable Systems

## Abstract

This document explores the concept of a URI-based format for expressing content-addressed identifiers (such as IPFS CIDs) optionally augmented with one or more provider hints. This format aims to support a simple, unopinionated, transport-agnostic scheme to simplify data retrieval in content-addressable systems by introducing a clear, extensible, and broadly compatible URI format.

## Background

Content-addressable systems, such as IPFS, allow data to be identified by the hash of its contents (CID), enabling verifiable, immutable references. However, retrieving content typically relies on side content discovery systems (e.g. DHT, IPNI), even when a client MAY know one (or more) provider of the bytes. A provider in this context is any node, peer, gateway, or service that can serve content identified by a CID.

Existing solutions (e.g., magnet URIs, RASL) propose alternative ideas where provider hints are encoded next to the content identifier. This document aims to explore this space in more detail, focusing particularly on ergonomics, extensibility, and ease of adoption.

## Requirements, Goals, and Non-Goals

This section defines the core motivations and constraints guiding the design of a URI format suitable for provider-hinted content addressing. It is worth noting that while the document focus on IPFS examples, the format design aims to be agnostic of IPFS.

### Goals

| Goal                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low-effort adoption**           | Enable systems like IPFS (e.g., Kubo, Helia), gateways, etc., to adopt the format with minimal changes. Or even no changes by relying on current discovery systems.             |
| **Extensible hint system**        | Support encoding multiple transport hints (e.g., HTTP, TCP), while extensible to support intermediary hops (e.g. IPNI, RASL), priorities/fallbacks, etc.                        |
| **Preserve base compatibility**   | Maintain compatibility with existing URI forms such as `ipfs://CID/...` and HTTP gateway URLs.                                                                                  |
| **Ergonomic for CLI and sharing** | Should be human-editable, URL-query-based, no strict URL-encoding beyond what browsers or CLIs already handle. Easy to copy/paste, share, or edit by hand.                      |
| **Publisher-driven**              | Allow publishers to encode as much transport/discovery information as they want, with no requirement for intermediary systems. They can disappear, yet the link remains useful. |
| **Fallback resilience**           | URI should encode enough to allow clients to attempt various fallbacks or resolve via discovery (e.g., DHT, IPNI).                                                              |
| **Self-descriptive**              | May support optional encoding of content types to enable clients to understand how to interpret the content after verification.                                                 |
| **Protocol-agnostic**             | Must not be tied to HTTP-only systems. Other transport protocols, like the ones supported by libp2p, must be possible to use if encoded as hints.                               |
| **Forward-compatible**            | Format should support future expansions: new hint types, encodings, content representations, etc.                                                                               |

### Non-Goals

| Non-Goal                                            | Reason                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Replace existing `ipfs://` or HTTP gateway URLs** | This format builds upon and extends them; not a replacement.                                                                       |
| **Strictly define a resolution order**              | Clients may choose how and in what order to try hints or fallback strategies.                                                      |
| **Mandate use of a centralized service**            | While some hints may include centralized endpoints (e.g., HTTP URLs), the URI format should support fully decentralized retrieval. |
| **Guarantee live access**                           | A hint may point to an offline, censored or throttled node. The client may use other hints or its own discovery logic.             |
| **Act as a trust layer**                            | These URIs do not manage identity or trust directly‚Äîverification remains based on CID integrity.                                   |

### Requirements

| Requirement                              | Reasoning                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CID as core address**                  | Content addressing should always resolve to a CID. Provider hints decorate, not replace, this.                                                      |
| **Multi-hint support**                   | Support multiple hints per URI, enabling clients to try multiple fetch paths if one fails.                                                          |
| **Hinted provider must be optional**     | Clients without support for hints must still be able to resolve using traditional discovery (DHT, IPNI, etc.), if the publisher set it up.          |
| **No required translation step**         | Links should not require dynamic translation (e.g., via an origin-based redirector). Links are self-contained.                                      |
| **Minimal client assumptions**           | Clients may safely ignore unknown hints and still function. This ensures progressive enhancement.                                                   |
| **Composable with Gateway URLs**         | Hints should not break Gateway-based access patterns. For example, users should be able to use URLs like `https://gw.io/ipfs/CID?provider=http...`. |
| **Multiaddr-based hint syntax**          | For transport-agnosticism, hints should leverage multiaddr representation.                                                                          |
| **No third-party resolution dependency** | Links should work standalone‚Äîresolution should not depend on reaching a third-party registry or lookup service.                                     |
| **No strict encoding rules**             | Except for standard URI syntax, do not require opaque encodings. Hints should be human-readable when possible.                                      |

## üé® URI Design

This section defines a URI format for expressing a content identifier (CID) along with optional provider hints that **guide clients** on how/where to fetch the associated content. The format is intended to be directly compatible with both IPFS Gateway URLs and `ipfs://` scheme URIs, while preserving flexibility and extensibility to also be compatible with other systems or upgrades.

Please note that the current format is not intended to fully specify all identified use cases or requirements. But focus on leaving the door open to more in depth specifications for specific cases.

### üìê Format

The proposed URI format introduces a new optional query parameter `provider`, which may appear one or more times. Each `provider` value represents a content provider hint and is composed by a `multiaddr` string. The `provider` parameter is optional, and clients MAY ignore it.

The base format is:

```sh!
[ipfs://<CID> | https://<gateway>/ipfs/<CID> | https://<CID>.ipfs.<gateway> ]?[provider=<multiaddr1>&provider=<multiaddr22>&...]
```

#### Query Parameter: `provider`

- Name: `provider`
- Type: URI Query Parameter (repeating allowed)
- Value: Multiaddr string (`?provider=multiaddr`).
- Interpretation: Optional hint for how to fetch and locate the content identified by the CID
- The `multiaddr` MAY include application level private tuples to specify the retrieval protocols supported (e.g. `/ip4/.../p2p/qmfoo/retrieval/bitswap/retrieval/http`), in order to enable the client to avoid unecessary interactions with providers (e.g. no need for protocol probing or identification). Including it is encouraged for low-latency, non-interactive lookups.

### Retrieval Protocol Code Registry (Informative)

| Protocol Code | Description               |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| http          | Trustless IPFS Gateway v1 |
| bitswap       | IPFS Bitswap protocol     |
| graphsync     | GraphSync protocol        |

### üß† Parsing

The CID is the core of a Provider-Hinted URI. Clients MUST extract the CID before evaluating any hints. The format is designed to be compatible with current IPFS like URIs, while explicitly defining how to locate the CID and interpret `provider` query parameters.

#### CID Extraction Rules

To ensure consistent parsing, clients MUST extract the CID using the following precedence rules:

**1. Multi-dotted Origin Format**

If the CID is encoded as a subdomain label (e.g., `https://<CID>.ipfs.<gateway>`):

- The CID MUST be the left-most label.
- The label immediately following MUST be `ipfs`.
- Any path MUST NOT also include a CID.

**Example:**  
‚úÖ `https://bafy...ipfs.dweb.link`  
‚ùå `https://bafy...ipfs.dweb.link/ipfs/bafybogus` (ambiguous; reject)

**2. Path-Based Format**

If the CID is encoded in the path (e.g., `https://<gateway>/ipfs/<CID>`):

- The path MUST match the pattern `/ipfs/<CID>`, where `<CID>` is a valid content identifier.

**Example:**  
‚úÖ `https://gateway.io/ipfs/bafy...`  
‚ùå `https://gateway.io/bafy...` (no `/ipfs/` marker)

**3. ipfs:// Scheme Format**

- The CID MUST immediately follow the scheme delimiter: `ipfs://<CID>`.
- Additional path/query components MAY follow.

**Example:**  
‚úÖ `ipfs://bafy...`

**4. Conflict Resolution**

If a CID is present in both a multi-dotted origin and in the path (even if they match), the URI MUST be rejected as ambiguous.

---

#### Query Parsing (`provider` Parameters)

Once a CID has been successfully extracted, clients MAY parse `provider` parameters from the query string. Each `provider` value represents a provider hint, encoded as a multiaddr string.

**1. Parsing Rules**

- The `provider` query parameter MAY appear multiple times.
- CLients MUST split each `provider` multiaddr by its components, so that they can look at encoded supported protocol codes.
- If no supported protocols are present, treat the entire value as a multiaddr with no protocol hint.
- Each `provider` parameter MUST be treated as an independent, optional provider hint.
- Clients MAY ignore hints with unknown protocol codes.

**2. Evaluate hints**

- Clients MAY:
  - Ignore all `provider` parameters (if unsupported).
  - Ignore unknown or unsupported protocols in a `provider` value (progressive enhancement).
  - Attempt to figure out what protocol to use in case protocol is omitted. They can either inspect the multiaddr and infer IPFS trustless gateway is used, or rely on extra hops like libp2p identify protocol.
  - Evaluate hints in order of appearance (left-to-right).
  - Evaluate hints in parallel.
  - Apply their own prioritization or fallback strategies. If all hints fail, clients SHOULD fall back to default discovery strategies (e.g., DHT/IPNI), if available. Or even rely on discovery strategies in parallel.

Note that the `multiaddr` string should point to the `origin` server where given CID is provided, and not include the actual CID in the Hint multiaddr as a subdomain/path.

#### Example Parsing Flows

**Input URI:**
`https://bafy....ipfs.dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http`
‚Üí **REJECT** (CID appears in both hostname and path)

**Input URI:**
`https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http&provider=/ip4/192.0.2.1/tcp/4001/ws/retrieval/bitswap`

‚Üí Extract CID: `bafy...`
‚Üí Parse `provider` params:

1. `/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https` using `http`
2. `/ip4/192.0.2.1/tcp/4001/ws` using `bitswap`
   ‚Üí Attempt connections via hints or fall back to default resolution.

**Input URI:**
`https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http/retrieval/bitswap`

‚Üí Extract CID: `bafy...`
‚Üí Parse `provider` params:

1. `/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https` using `http` or `bitswap`
   ‚Üí Attempt connections via hints or fall back to default resolution.

**Input URI:**
`https://bafy....ipfs.dweb.link?provider=/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https`

‚Üí Extract CID: `bafy...`
‚Üí Parse `provider` params:

1. `/dns/hash-stream-like-server.io/tcp/443/https` using `http` (while not explicit, client MAY infer it by http like multiaddr)

### Client Behavior and potential Server Roles

In addition to guiding client-side resolution, provider hints can be interpreted by servers under certain circumstances. The semantics of hint placement influence visibility and use:

- If the `provider` parameter is included in the **query** (`?...`), it MAY be communicated to the server depending on the client parsing the parameter.
- If the `provider` is encoded as a **fragment** (`#...`), it is only accessible to the client (browsers do not send fragments to the server).

This distinction allows URI publishers to tailor behavior:

- **Client-only mode:** Use a fragment (`#provider=...`) to ensure the server remains unaware of hint data. This is useful for privacy-preserving client apps or when hints are intended to guide only the client.
- **Server-assisted mode:** Use query parameters (`?provider=...`) to allow the server to parse and act on provider hints. This may enable proxy behavior, similar to existing IPFS gateways like `ipfs.io` or `dweb.link`.

Publishers of such URIs should consider the **security profile** and **trust assumptions** of their environment when deciding how to encode hints.

This flexibility supports a spectrum of use cases‚Äîfrom fully local client-side fetch strategies to cooperative client-server resolution pipelines.

### Optional: Error Handling Guidelines

| Scenario                                              | Client Behavior                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Invalid CID format                                    | Reject URI                                  |
| No CID found                                          | Reject URI                                  |
| Invalid `provider` value                              | Log/ignore and proceed with remaining hints |
| Unknown protocols in multiaddr                        | Ignore that hint                            |
| CID + `provider` parse correctly but connection fails | Try next hint or fallback resolution        |

## Examples

### Compatible with Gateway URL

```
https://example.gateway.io/ipfs/bafy...?
  provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server.com/tcp/443/https
  &provider=/ip4/98.10.2.1/tcp/8000/ws/retrieval/http
```

### Compatible with `ipfs://` URI

```
ipfs://bafy...?
  provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server.com/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http
```

These providers hints can be evaluated by clients in any order (sequentially or in parallel), or ignored entirely if unsupported.

## Inspiration Sources

- **Magnet URIs** (BitTorrent): flexible metadata + providers hints.
- **RASL**: Rich, semantic locator abstraction for IPFS.
- **IPFS Paths and Multiaddrs**: Encapsulation of identifiers and providers.
- **URIs and IRIs**: Established practices for extensible, parseable identifiers.

## Potential Next Steps

This document provides a foundational format but leaves room for future refinements. Next steps may include:

- Validation of this exploration with an implementation.
- Tooling to generate and validate provider-hinted URIs.

## üìé Appendix

### Human-Friendly URI Format

```txt!
https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http
```

- Easy to paste into a browser.
- Copy/paste-friendly.
- Readable and editable.

#### üåê Browser Behavior

If you paste this URI into a browser:

```txt!
ipfs://bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http
```

- The browser encodes unsafe characters like `/` and `:`.
- Internally it becomes:

```txt!
ipfs://bafy...?provider=%2Fdns%2Fmy-hash-stream-server%2Ftcp%2F443%2Fhttps%3Aretrieval%2Fhttp
```

‚úÖ This is expected and does not affect usability.

#### üß™ JavaScript (Browser or Node.js)

```js!
const url = new URL("https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http");
const hints = url.searchParams.getAll("provider");
for (const hint of hints) {
  console.log("Multiaddr:", hint);  // "/dns/my-hash-stream-server/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http"
}
```

- ‚úÖ URLSearchParams handles decoding for you.
- ‚úÖ No need to deal with %2F, %3A, etc.
- ‚úÖ Safe and ergonomic for all developers.

#### üíª CLI Usage

```sh!
curl "https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http"
```

- ‚úÖ Use quotes (`"..."` or `'...'`) if your shell interprets special characters.
- ‚úÖ No need for manual escaping or encoding.

Works great in:

- `curl`
- `wget`
- Kubo CLI
- Custom CLI tools

| ‚ùå **Unsupported client**                     | Client ignores `provider` param and uses default discovery (e.g., DHT/IPNI)                                                                                 |

### Usage & Adoption

This format is designed for gradual and low-effort adoption. Systems like IPFS nodes (e.g., Kubo), browser clients (e.g., Helia), and gateways can:

- Parse and extract the CID from the URI as usual.
- Optionally inspect and interpret `provider` query parameters if present.
- Ignore unknown parameters to maintain compatibility.
- Use multiaddr libraries to parse and attempt hinted connections.
- Fall back to DHT/IPNI or existing discovery methods if hints fail.

Clients MAY evaluate hints sequentially or in parallel and MAY prioritize based on local heuristics.

### CLI Friendly Usage

This format is designed to be easily usable in CLI pipelines and automation flows. For example:

```sh!
curl-like "https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server.com/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http" | <verifier> | <consumer-app>
```

Assuming curl at some point would adopt content addressable verifiable client, it could look like:

```sh!
curl "https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafy...?provider=/dns/my-hash-stream-server.com/tcp/443/https/retrieval/http" | <verifier> | <consumer-app>
```
